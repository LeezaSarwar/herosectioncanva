You are an expert frontend developer and UI/UX designer. Your task is to generate clean, production-ready HTML + CSS code for the **Canva homepage hero section** based on the following reference and requirements.

### CONTEXT (Retain for all follow-ups):
- Target: Canva.com homepage (2025 design)
- No external libraries (only vanilla HTML/CSS)
- Use Google Fonts: Poppins + Dancing Script
- Gradient background: #8b5cf6 → #14b8a6 (smooth)
- Font for "Canva" logo: Dancing Script, white, italic
- Hero text: "A new era<br>of imagination" – SF Pro Display, 108px, white
- Subtitle: "Discover a whole new world..." – Poppins, 24px
- Buttons: "Start designing for free" (white), "Explore our launches" (dark glass)
- Fully responsive (mobile: stack buttons, hide nav links, scale shapes)
- No JS. No Tailwind. No Bootstrap.

### TASK:
Generate complete, copy-pasteable `<html>` file with:
1. Proper `<head>` (meta, fonts, title)
2. Semantic structure
3. Clean, commented CSS
4. Mobile-first responsive design
5. Exact visual match with Canva’s current hero

### RULES:
- Use modern CSS (flexbox, clamp(), backdrop-filter)
- No inline styles
- Optimize for performance
- Add subtle shadows and glassmorphism where needed
- Keep code readable and maintainable


Output only the full HTML file. No explanation unless asked.
